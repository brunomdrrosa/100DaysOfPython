## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card

def calculate_score(cards):
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)

def compare(user_score, computer_score):
    if user_score > 21 and computer_score > 21:
        return "VocÃª passou de 21. VocÃª perdeu"
    if user_score == computer_score:
        return "Deu empate"
    elif computer_score == 0:
        return "VocÃª perdeu, o computador conseguiu 21 pontos"
    elif user_score == 0:
        return "VocÃª ganhou com 21 pontos"
    elif user_score > 21:
        return "VocÃª passou de 21. VocÃª perdeu"
    elif computer_score > 21:
        return "VocÃª ganhou, o computador passou de 21 pontos"
    elif user_score > computer_score:
        return "VocÃª ganhou"
    else:
        return "VocÃª perdeu"

    print(logo)

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
    
    user_cards = []
    computer_cards = []
    is_game_over = False

    for carta in range(2):
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        computer_cards.append(deal_card())

    while not is_game_over:
        user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
        computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
        print(f"Suas cartas sÃ£o: {user_cards}, pontuaÃ§Ã£o atual: {user_score}")
        print(f"Primeira carta do computador: {computer_cards[0]}")

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
# âœ…

#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
# âœ…

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
# âœ…

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.
        if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
            is_game_over = True
        else:
#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.
            draw = input("VocÃª quer comprar uma nova carta? 'S' ou 'N'\n").lower()
            if draw == "s":
                user_cards.append(deal_card())
            elif draw == "n":
                is_game_over = True
#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.
    while computer_score != 0 and computer_score < 17:
        computer_cards.append(deal_card())
        computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
    print(f"Suas cartas sÃ£o: {user_cards}, pontuaÃ§Ã£o final: {user_score}")
    print(f"As cartas do computador sÃ£o: {computer_cards}, pontuaÃ§Ã£o final: {computer_score}")
    print(compare(user_score, computer_score))

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
while input("VocÃª quer jogar uma partida de Blackjack novamente? Digite 'S' ou 'N': ").lower() == "s":
    cls = lambda: os.system('cls')
    cls()
    jogar()
