# Setup and Context

### Introduction

Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/WfUSSP7.png height=350>

To accomplish your task you will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split your data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price

# Understand the Relationships in the Data

### Run a Pair Plot

**Challenge**

There might be some relationships in the data that we should know about. Before you run the code, make some predictions:

* What would you expect the relationship to be between pollution (NOX) and the distance to employment (DIS)? 
* What kind of relationship do you expect between the number of rooms (RM) and the home value (PRICE)?
* What about the amount of poverty in an area (LSTAT) and home prices? 

Run a [Seaborn `.pairplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html?highlight=pairplot#seaborn.pairplot) to visualise all the relationships at the same time. Note, this is a big task and can take 1-2 minutes! After it's finished check your intuition regarding the questions above on the `pairplot`.
